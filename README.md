# Numerical-Methods
This project implements numerical methods in Python to solve linear systems, including Cholesky, LU decomposition (PLU), and iterative methods like Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR, Conjugate Gradient, and Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient. Performance is evaluated by comparing computed solutions with the exact solution using various norms.
